   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd article-manager

2. Create a .env file and configure the following variables:
    # Example .env file
    DATABASE_USER=your_database_user
    DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_database_password
    API_KEY=your_api_key

---------------------------------------------------------


### Observations:
1. **The application seeds itself automatically on the first run.**
2. **A scheduled job runs daily to continue seeding the database (for demonstration purposes only; this is not required for testing functionality).Development Mode:**
3. **The database is destroyed and rebuilt every time the containers are restarted.**
4. **To make API requests, you need a personal_access_token. Generate this token by registering at the /register endpoint. Use the token in your request headers: Authorization: Bearer {token}**
